# Week One Top K Elements Challenge
For Week One I solved the Top K elements Challenge from Leet Code and below is more on the challenge


## About the Challenge

We are given an integer **array nums** and an **integer k**, from the two we are supposed to return the k most frequent elements. We may return the answer in any order.

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
- It is guaranteed that the answer is unique

The challenged was solved and explained. Below are the Resources Shared
