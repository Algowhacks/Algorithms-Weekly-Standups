# Data Structures And Algorithms Explained
Algowhacks is a group of passionate Tech ecosystem members that come together to make Data Structures and Algorithm A walk in the park for all of its members.

I don’t mean to say that we are all Savvy but as the Swahili Say “Papo kwa Papo Kamba Hukata Jiwe”. Despite our varying degrees of knowledge, we all come together to learn from one another and encourage diversity in our learning process.

In our daily stand-up sessions, a member solves a coding difficulty, explains the answer to the other members, and we all learn from it and discuss our various perspectives on the challenge.

This Repository will contain all my weekly stand up sessions, Resources Shared and Recordings(If Any).


## Stand up Sessions [**👨‍🏫**](https://yaytext.com/emoji/teacher/)

Below  is a list of all the stand up sessions I have held on different coding challenges weekly. This though, is not limited to weekly as one can present a number of times in a week at her will with the approval of the group members.

## Contribution 🤝🏻

As we say, “Open Source is the new Sauce”. Hence not allowing you to participate and contribute in this repository would not be justice done.

I always share resources in every session which might be of help to the group members to understand the concept even deeper, so can you.

Do you have any contribution you want to make. Another way of solving the challenge or add some more resources that were helpful to you, come and share with us.
All contributions are welcomed but be sure to follow the GitHub Workflow and Group guidelines.

 I cant wait to merge your pull requests 🥳
